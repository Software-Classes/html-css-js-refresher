        external css
        what are the benefits of external css?
        - It helps to keep the HTML file clean and organized.
        - It allows for easier maintenance and updates since styles are in a separate file.
        - It enables reusability of styles across multiple HTML files.

    <!-- 
        Some people usually use external; there is no way I see external CSS was formed 
        was because of the rise of something we call a design system. So if you know what 
        a design system is, then you will be good at what you call CSS, especially external CSS.
        So that is what I'm going to introduce you to. Before I go deep into external CSS, 
        just give me a few brief five minutes; I will show you what a design system is. So brace for impact.
